title: "Luiss Guido Carli | PhD in Politics | Mixed Methods"
---

# Course description

Many researchers are trained in the use of one primary method. Using an innovative method may require them to reach out across their own methods of comfort zone, to think outside their normal everyday methods routine. The course on mixed methods will introduce the students into a rather new set of research methods.

A mixed method research (MMR) is a research program in which methods of different types (qualitative and quantitative) are combined to provide a richer set of insights about the phenomenon under exam (including its context) and to reach greater confidence in the conclusions generated by the research. 

# Learning outcomes

The main goal is to enable the students to enrich and deepen their traditional academic tool-box on methods of social research, and familiarize with the basic elements of mixed methods research (MMR) to learn how to handle the methodological choices they are going to face in preparing their PhD dissertation relying on a larger and new set of options, beyond the purely quantitative and/or purely qualitative approaches, being well aware of the advantages and pitfalls implied in conducting research in applied settings, to get used to deal with and manage to solve the methodological issues students face in their daily research practices (writing up a research proposal, designing research methods, evaluating and selecting of different tools for mixed methods data collection and analysis, writing a mixed-method research report), avoiding ritualized take away recipes, and progressing in their scientific endeavor through peer-to-peer, open and informed debate. Students will also be introduced to the logics and workings of Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA).

After completing the module students will be able to:

## Knowledge and understanding

1.  Identify an appropriate research topic,

2.  Spell out research aims and objectives,

## Applying knowledge and understanding

3.  Design an indicative literature review synthesizing material and write it in their own words,

4.  develop a research design and select appropriate methods,

5.  set up a complete and coherent research proposal.

    ## Making judgments

6.  Apply in a coherent and rigorous manner the principles of critical thinking for the purpose of correct and complete understanding of the results of research conducted using alternative and/or similar methodological solutions to those adopted in one’s own study.

7.  Compare the utilised paradigms in mixed or combined methods research and apply the relevant theories to the design and finalization of one’s own research.

    ## Communication skills

8.  Present research results to a peer and general audience.

9.  Present in a rigorous and comprehensive manner, to a multi-disciplinary research audience, the results of the research conducted according to mixed or combined methods.

10. Design and write a research paper and/or report that meets the guiding criteria, styles and heuristic directions typical of mixed or combined methods studies.

    ## Learning skills

    The course aims to broaden the range of methodological skills and technical solutions applicable in field research along three lines:

    11. Attention to scientifically relevant innovations emerging in the methodological field (according to both quantitative and qualitative approaches).
    12. Systematic care applied to the research processes, in particular for what concerns the activities in the field and intended for the direct and technically consistent measurement of the phenomena under investigation.
    13. Assessment of the integrability and effective integration of the quantitative and/or qualitative information bases constructed in the course of field research.

# Assessment

The final course grade will be expressed in thirtieths (/30). A pass mark will be attained with a minimum mark of 18/30, while the maximum mark will be 30/30 cum laude. The course will require both active class participation and a successful completion of a number of tasks/activities as follows:

## *Participation in class*

Students will be expected to attend all the seminars and contribute to class discussions. It is essential that course participants prepare fully for classes by reading the required material. Participation will contribute to 15% of the final grade.

## *Class presentation*

Each student will have to present to the class one scientific article listed among the examples of the second part of the course (week 6 to 9) and discuss the research design along with its strengths and weaknesses. The presentation will contribute to 25% of the final grade.

## *Final paper*

This is the main requirement for the course (60% of the final grade). The paper will serve as an important exercise in how to design a social science research proposal that includes a mixed method design and will hopefully serve as the basis for students’ dissertation project. The paper should contain (1) the central research question(s), (2) the literature and/or debate it seeks to address, (3) the argument or theory/hypotheses, (4) a description of the mixed method design to be used in the project, (5) case selection criteria, and (6) a plan for data collection and analysis that will serve to answer the research question(s). The paper should be between 3,000 and 4,000 words.

# Academic Honesty

As stated in the university catalog, any student who commits an act of academic dishonesty will receive a failing grade on the work in which the dishonesty occurred. In addition, acts of academic dishonesty, irrespective of the weight of the assignment, may result in the student receiving a failing grade in the course. Instances of academic dishonesty will be reported to the Dean of Academic Affairs. A student who is reported twice for academic dishonesty is subject to summary dismissal from the University. In such a case, the Academic Council will then make a recommendation to the President, who will make the final decision.
